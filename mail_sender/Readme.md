# Python Mail Sender (Automate Mailing)
---------------------------------------

**This is a simple Python script for sending emails using the smtplib library. It's designed to be a straightforward tool for sending emails programmatically.**

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to have a Gmail account from which you'll be sending the emails.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash 
 git clone https://github.com/harsh-a-parihar/Small-Projects-in-Python/tree/master/mail_sender
```

2. Make sure to replace placeholders in the script (`MY_EMAIL`, `MY_PASSWORD`, recipient's email address, subject, and content) with your actual email credentials and desired information.

3. You can optionally automate the process using PythonAnywhere. Visit [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) and deploy the code, setting it to run at scheduled intervals.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the `content.txt` file contains the content you want to send in the email.
2. Run the script using Python:
```bash
main.py
```
